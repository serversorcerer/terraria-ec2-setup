3. **Establish RDP Connection**: Use your instance's public IP and the retrieved admin password from the EC2 console.
4. **Deploy Terraria Server**: Utilize SteamCMD for the game server installation.
5. **Server Configuration**: Execute `TerrariaServer.exe` to customize your server setup.
6. **Ongoing Maintenance**: Implement regular backups of your game world and monitor server performance.
